If the last argument passed into ``this.emit`` is a function, it is assumed to be a callback that accepts a boolean indicating whether to continue the event (``true``) or cancel it (``false``).\n2. The ``.on`` and ``.once`` methods try to \"guess\" if the provided handler is synchronous or asynchronous (based on its argument length), or can be explicitly registered as synchronous or asynchronous with ``.onSync``, ``.onAsync``, ``.onceSync``, ``.onceAsync``.\n3. Passing the maximum number of listeners allowed will fire off a ``maxListenersPassed`` event with the event name and listener count as arguments. The warning the official ``EventEmitter`` prints is simply a listener for ``async-cancelable-events``, and can be disabled by running ``this.removeAllListeners('maxListenersPassed')`` just after the ``EventEmitter.call(this)`` listed above.\n4. The various method calls are chainable, so ``foo.on('bar', func1).on('baz', func2)`` is valid.\n\n## License (MIT)\n\nCopyright (C) 2012-2013 by David Ellis\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
